# 5 Quick Fixes to Boost Your Home's Curb Appeal

First impressions matter, especially when it comes to your home. Whether you're planning to sell or just want your house to stand out on the block, improving your curb appeal is one of the easiest ways to add value to your property. Here are five quick and affordable fixes to give your home a fresh look—perfect for anyone who wants to tackle a project this weekend!

## 1. Repaint the Front Door

Nothing brightens up a home’s exterior like a fresh coat of paint on the front door. Opt for a bold color that complements your house’s style and surrounding landscape. If you're not sure which color works best, we can help you choose and professionally repaint your door for a long-lasting finish.

**DIY Tip**: Be sure to use exterior paint to withstand weather conditions. If painting seems like too big of a task, don't hesitate to give us a call for expert assistance!

## 2. Install New Outdoor Lighting

Good lighting not only improves your home's safety but also creates a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Consider upgrading to modern fixtures or adding path lights along your walkway. 

**Safety Note**: Electrical work can be tricky. If you're not comfortable working with wiring, it's best to leave the installation to professionals. We offer affordable exterior lighting installation starting at $140, making it easy to light up your home.

## 3. Update Your House Numbers

An often overlooked but simple update is swapping out your old house numbers for something more modern. Choose a sleek, easy-to-read style that complements your home’s design. It’s a small touch that makes a big impact.

**Pro Tip**: Our team can install new house numbers, ensuring they are securely mounted and visible.

## 4. Refresh Your Landscaping

A little landscaping goes a long way in improving curb appeal. Trim your bushes, add fresh mulch, and consider planting flowers or low-maintenance greenery to frame your front entrance. Not much of a gardener? We can step in to give your yard a professional touch.

## 5. Clean and Power Wash Exterior Surfaces

Over time, dirt and grime can build up on your siding, driveway, and walkways. A quick power wash can instantly freshen up your home’s exterior, making it look as good as new. 

**Warning**: Power washing without the right equipment or experience can damage your surfaces. Our professional power washing service is available for $150 per hour, ensuring that your home is cleaned thoroughly without any risk of damage.
