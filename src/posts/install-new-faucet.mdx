# The Right Way to Install a New Faucet

Upgrading your faucet is a simple way to refresh your kitchen or bathroom, but **plumbing can get tricky fast**. A small mistake could leave you with leaks, water damage, or even worse—costly repairs down the line.

If the idea of working with plumbing makes you nervous, don't worry—we're here to help. **Coachella Valley Handyman** can install your new faucet quickly and professionally for **$140**, saving you the hassle and ensuring everything is watertight.

---

### What You’ll Need:
- Adjustable wrench
- Basin wrench
- Plumber's tape
- New faucet
- Towels or bucket (to catch any water)
- Silicone sealant

---

### Step 1: Shut Off the Water
First, locate the water shutoff valves under your sink and turn them off. This step is critical—**never attempt to work on plumbing without turning off the water**. Even a small drip could escalate into a much bigger problem.

Still feeling uneasy about it? **Give us a call.** For **$140**, we’ll handle the job from start to finish, ensuring you won’t have to deal with any unexpected water surprises.

### Step 2: Disconnect the Old Faucet
Use your adjustable wrench to disconnect the water supply lines from the faucet. Be sure to place a towel or bucket under the sink to catch any excess water. Then, using a basin wrench, loosen the nuts holding the old faucet in place.

If you find yourself struggling with tight or corroded nuts, don’t force it—**we can come help** before things go south.

### Step 3: Install the New Faucet
Position the new faucet into the sink’s mounting holes. Most new faucets come with a gasket, but if yours doesn't, apply a small bead of silicone sealant around the base before placing it in position.

This part can get tricky, especially if you’re unsure about aligning everything just right. If you feel overwhelmed, **don't hesitate to reach out**—we can handle the installation for you quickly and securely.

### Step 4: Connect the Water Supply Lines
Reattach the water supply lines to the faucet using the adjustable wrench. Make sure they are snug but don’t overtighten them. Use plumber’s tape on the threads to prevent leaks.

Again, if you’re unsure about any step of the process, we’re here to help. **Call us** for professional installation and avoid any potential mess!

### Step 5: Turn the Water Back On and Test
Once everything is connected, turn the water back on and test your new faucet for leaks. Run both hot and cold water to ensure a proper connection. 

**Any signs of dripping?** Even a small leak can lead to bigger problems. Call us, and we’ll come fix it for you—no need to deal with the stress or potential water damage!
