# Spring into Action: Essential Home Maintenance Tasks for the New Season

As the days grow longer and warmer, spring is the perfect time to tackle home maintenance tasks that keep your property safe, efficient, and beautiful. Here are essential maintenance tasks to include in your spring cleaning routine.

## 1. Inspect Your Roof

Winter weather can take a toll on your roof. Look for missing shingles, leaks, or any signs of wear. Addressing these issues early can prevent more significant damage later.

**Warning**: If you’re not comfortable on a ladder, our roofing services can help ensure your roof is in top condition.

## 2. Clean and Check Gutters

Spring rains can lead to overflowing gutters if they’re clogged with leaves and debris. Clean your gutters and check for any signs of damage to ensure proper drainage.

**Pro Tip**: If you need help, our gutter cleaning service can handle this for you.

## 3. Check Exterior Paint

Inspect the exterior of your home for any peeling or chipped paint. Touching up these areas will not only enhance your home’s curb appeal but also protect against weather damage.

## 4. Service Your HVAC System

Before the heat of summer sets in, ensure your air conditioning system is in good working order. Change filters, clean ducts, and schedule a professional service if needed.

## 5. Maintain Your Landscaping

Spring is the ideal time to tend to your landscaping. Trim shrubs, plant new flowers, and ensure your yard is looking its best. Proper landscaping can enhance your home’s curb appeal.

## 6. Check Safety Equipment

Test smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors to ensure they are functioning correctly. Replace batteries as needed to keep your home safe.
