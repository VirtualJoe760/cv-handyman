# How to Change a Light Fixture Without Risking Your Safety

Updating a light fixture may seem straightforward, but handling electricity can be dangerous if you don't take proper precautions. A few wrong moves, and you could be looking at more than just a dark room—you could end up with a serious injury or damage to your home. While some homeowners feel confident taking on this project, others may feel a little unsure, and that’s okay.

If at any point this project feels daunting, **don't risk it**—our professional team is here to help! We can change your light fixtures for just **$140**, ensuring your home stays safe and functional.

### What You’ll Need:
- Screwdriver (Phillips or flathead)
- Voltage tester (This is a must to ensure the power is off)
- Wire connectors (In case the existing ones are worn out)
- New light fixture
- Ladder (if needed)
- Wire cutters/strippers

---

### Step 1: Turn Off the Power
**Safety first!** Head straight to your circuit breaker and turn off the power to the room where you’ll be working. This step cannot be skipped—electricity is **dangerous**. After flipping the breaker, test the switch to make sure the power is off.

If you don’t have a voltage tester to double-check, we highly recommend letting a professional handle this for you. Don’t take any chances when it comes to electricity.

### Step 2: Remove the Old Fixture
Once you're certain the power is off, carefully remove the old fixture. Most are held in place with screws on the mounting plate. Unscrew them, then slowly lower the fixture. Be careful not to pull down on the wiring.

*Feeling a bit uneasy?* This is where many people start to feel unsure. If you’re one of them, **give us a call**! Our handyman services start at just **$150/hour**, and we’ll safely remove and install your fixture for you.

### Step 3: Disconnect the Wires
You’ll see three wires: black (hot), white (neutral), and a green or copper wire (ground). **Never touch these wires without verifying the power is off**. Carefully disconnect the wire connectors and separate the fixture from the ceiling.

### Step 4: Install the New Fixture
Start by connecting the new fixture's wires to the ceiling wires—black to black, white to white, and ground to ground. Secure them tightly with wire connectors. Next, attach the mounting plate and carefully screw in the new fixture.

Feeling unsure about wiring? **Don’t risk it.** Let us handle the installation for you. We’ve installed countless light fixtures, ensuring they're safe and secure.

### Step 5: Test the Fixture
Once the fixture is installed and secure, turn the power back on at the circuit breaker. Flip the switch to test your new light. 

**If something doesn’t seem right, don't hesitate to call us**—electrical work is no joke, and we’re here to ensure everything is done safely and correctly.
