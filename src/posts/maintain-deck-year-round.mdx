# How to Maintain Your Deck for Year-Round Enjoyment

Your deck is an extension of your home, providing an outdoor space to relax, entertain, and enjoy the beauty of your yard. To keep it looking great and ensure its longevity, regular maintenance is key. Here are some easy tips to keep your deck in top shape throughout the year. And if you’d rather skip the hassle, our team is ready to step in and take care of it for you!

## 1. Clean Regularly

Dirt, leaves, and debris can accumulate quickly on your deck, especially after the fall season. A regular sweep will prevent stains and moisture build-up that can lead to damage over time. For a deeper clean, power washing is the way to go.

**Safety Tip**: If you're power washing your deck, be careful not to damage the wood by using too much pressure. If you're unsure about the right technique, consider hiring a professional. We offer power washing services for $150 per hour to ensure your deck is cleaned safely and effectively.

## 2. Inspect for Damage

Regularly check your deck for any signs of wear and tear, such as cracked boards, loose nails, or rot. These small issues can quickly escalate if not addressed.

**Pro Tip**: If you spot damage but aren’t sure how to fix it, Coachella Valley Handyman can inspect your deck and provide expert repairs to keep it safe and sturdy.

## 3. Apply a Protective Sealant

To protect your deck from the elements, it’s important to reseal it every couple of years. A good sealant will help prevent water damage, sun fading, and the growth of mold and mildew.

**DIY Tip**: Choose a clear or semi-transparent sealant to showcase the natural beauty of your deck’s wood. If the idea of sealing seems too time-consuming, our team can handle it for you, ensuring a smooth, professional application that lasts.

## 4. Repaint or Stain When Needed

If your deck is painted or stained, freshening it up every few years can make a huge difference in its appearance and longevity. Choose high-quality, weather-resistant products designed for outdoor use.

**Pro Tip**: Painting or staining a deck is a bigger project than it seems, and it’s easy to make a mess. Let our experts take care of it—our painting and sealing services ensure that your deck looks perfect.

## 5. Protect Your Deck from Winter Weather

If you live in an area with cold winters, protecting your deck from ice and snow is essential. Avoid using salt or de-icing chemicals, as they can damage the wood. Instead, use a plastic shovel to clear snow and prevent buildup.
